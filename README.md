# WebScrapperKbb

This project was instrumental in fetching data of used cars for the Statistical Data mining course project. The code is written in python using requests and Beautifulsoup package, here we collect specs data of 8 Car manufacturers having cars in both hatchback and Sedan segments, with mileage ranging from 10K -230 K miles. Still working on making this scrapper more generic.
